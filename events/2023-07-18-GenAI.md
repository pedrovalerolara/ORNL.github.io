<p align="justify">
Generative AI are revolutionary technologies impacting our daily human-computing interactions creating new content that matches human creativity. Among these, Large language models (LLM), in particular OpenAI’s generative Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) foundation models and Google's Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), have become a ubiquitous topic in the present era. Therefore, there is a strong need to understand their impact, limitations, responsible use, and broader implications for Oak Ridge National Laboratory's (ORNL) scientific mission.
</p>

# Aims and Scope

<p align="justify">
ORNL's Generative AI for Science Workshop series, invites the scientific community to share current challenges, requirements and opportunities for the ethical use of generative AI technologies in our mission. Our goal is to provide a venue to educate and exchange research and development ideas, collaborations and investments around the current state-of-the-art in these relatively new technologies. We welcome lightning talk proposals and panel participation from the wide range of experimental, observational, high-performance computing (HPC) projects at ORNL.  
We will summarize our ideas, findings and key opportunities in a subsequent report that we will share with the community and interested participants.
</p>

# Registration

<p align="justify">
While this is a hybrid event, we encourage in-person participation for the tutorial, working lunch session, lightning talks, panel discussions to learn more about Generative AI and build a community at ORNL.
</p>

**Registration Link:** Please register by **July 07th** filling out this [form](https://forms.gle/EmBoKJg5MLWQnuSk6). 

> External (virtual or in-person) participants need to apply for a Personal Access System (PAS). Participation is subject to approval. Contact the organizers for questions.

> Registration is still open for virtual participation until July 15th, in-person registration is closed.

> The registration form includes the option to propose a lightning talk focusing on the requirements for scientific areas that are representative of ORNL.

- **Registration is required for in-person and virtual meeting option via Zoom**
- **We encourage early registration for in-person participation due to the venue's limited capacity (closed)**

# Call for Lightning Talks

We invite ORNL participants to present a 3 to 5 minute lightning talk that aligns with the scope of the workshop (option provided in the registration form).

**Topics:**

- Scientific application requirements for the use of Generative AI
- Responsible use of generative AI for obsevational, experimental and computational science
- Training and educational challenges and requirements
- Ethical and legal implications on the use of Generative AI 
- Guardrails for generative AI models
- Large language models (LLMs): GPT, Bard, etc.
- Impact of LLMs in the scientific discovery process
