<br>[Dr. Raphaël Pestourie](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/raphael-pestourie)

**Abstract**

In this talk, I will showcase how surrogate models accelerate the evaluation of properties of PDE solutions.
I will present a precise definition of the computational benefit of surrogate models and example surrogate models.
We will then show how surrogate models can be combined to solve a challenging multiscale problem in optics.
We will show that, through a synergistic combination of data-driven methods and direct numerical simulations, surrogate-based models present a data-efficient and physics-enhanced approach to simulating and optimizing complex systems.
This approach has the benefit of being interpretable.
I will also share ways forward and opportunities where I am actively seeking collaborations.

**Accelerating Astronomical Discovery: Synergies Between Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Data-Driven Astronomy**

<br>Room: Building 5100, Room 140
<br>Time: 10-11 a.m. ET, Thursday, 03/25/2024
<br>[Dr. Yuan-Sen Ting](https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~yting/)

**Abstract**

The era of data-driven astronomy presents researchers with an unprecedented volume of data, comprising billions of images and tens of millions of spectra.
This abundance of information prompts critical questions about expediting astrophysical discoveries, uncovering previously undetected celestial phenomena, and deciphering the intricate physics governing the Universe.
In this presentation, we explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and astronomy, aiming to bridge existing gaps by harnessing the synergies between these domains.
We highlight the transformative potential of generative AI in tackling complex, non-linear inference problems that have traditionally been considered intractable, offering an alternative to conventional Bayesian inference methods.
Moreover, we introduce our work, AstroLLaMA, on developing a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically tailored for astronomical research.
This initiative leverages cutting-edge advancements in LLM technology to facilitate hypothesis generation and accelerate discoveries, laying the foundation for the realization of a fully integrated AI Astronomer.

**ChipNeMo: Domain-Adapted LLMs for Chip Design**

<br> Virtual (via Microsoft Teams)
<br> Time: 10-11 a.m. ET, Thursday, 04/11/2024
<br> [Robert Kirby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/areskay/), [Mingjie Liu](https://research.nvidia.com/person/mingjie-liu)

**Abstract**

[ChipNeMo](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-10_chipnemo-domain-adapted-llms-chip-design) aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design.
Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs, we instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques: custom tokenizers, domain-adaptive continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with domain-specific instructions, and domain-adapted retrieval models.
We evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design: an engineering assistant chatbot, EDA script generation, and bug summarization and analysis.
Our results show that these domain adaptation techniques enable significant LLM performance improvements over general-purpose base models across the three evaluated applications, enabling up to 5x model size reduction with similar or better performance on a range of design tasks.
Our findings also indicate that there’s still room for improvement between our current results and ideal outcomes.
We believe that further investigation of domain-adapted LLM approaches will help close this gap in the future.

**CHEMREASONER: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model’s Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback**

<br> Microsoft Teams
<br> Time: 10-11 a.m. ET, Monday, 04/25/2024
<br> [Dr. Sutanay Choudhury](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/sutanay-choudhury)

**Abstract**

The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future.
We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations.
Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)- derived feedback.
Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability.
Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and barriers steer the exploration in the LLM’s knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts.
We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations.
By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.

**NIST’s Autonomous Research Laboratories for Materials Exploration and Discovery**

<br> Room: TBA
<br> Time: 10-11 a.m. ET, Monday, 05/09/2024
<br> [Dr. A. Gilad Kusne](https://www.nist.gov/people/aaron-gilad-kusne)

**Abstract**

Autonomous research laboratories (also known as self-driving labs) accelerate the scientific process - letting scientists fail smarter, learn faster, and spend less resources in their studies.
This is achieved by placing machine learning in control of automated lab equipment, i.e., putting machine learning in the driver’s seat.
The user defines their goals and the machine learning then selects, performs, and analyzes experiments in a closed loop to home in on those goals.
By integrating prior knowledge into the machine learning framework, even greater accelerations can be achieved.
Knowledge sources include theory, computation, databases, and human intuition.
In this talk I will discuss NIST’s diverse set of autonomous labs for materials exploration and discovery.
I will also discuss how integrating external knowledge boosts their performance.

**Causal representation learning in temporal settings**

<br> Microsoft Teams
<br> Time: 11:00 a.m. - 12 p.m. ET, Thursday, 08/22/2024
<br> [Dr. Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io)

**Abstract**

Causal inference reasons about the effect of unseen interventions or external manipulations on a system.
Similar to classic approaches to AI, it typically assumes that the causal variables of interest are given from the outset.
However, real-world data often comprises high-dimensional, low-level observations (e.g., pixels in a video) and is thus usually not structured into such meaningful causal units.
Causal representation learning aims at addressing this gap by learning high-level causal variables along with their causal relations directly from raw, unstructured data, e.g. images or videos.

In this talk I will focus on learning causal representations in temporal sequences, e.g. sequences of images.
In particular I will present some of our recent work on causal representation learning in environments in which we can perform interventions or actions.
I will start by presenting CITRIS (https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03169), where we leveraged the knowledge of which variables are intervened in each timestep to learn a provably disentangled representation of the potentially multidimensional ground truth causal variables, as well as a dynamic bayesian network representing the causal relations between these variables.
I will then show iCITRIS (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06169), an extension that allows for instantaneous effects between variables.
Finally, I will focus on our most recent method, BISCUIT (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09643), which overcomes one of the biggest limitations of our previous methods: the need to know which variables are intervened.
In BISCUIT we instead leverage actions with unknown effects on an environment.
Assuming that each causal variable has exactly two distinct causal mechanisms, we prove that we can recover each ground truth variable from a sequence of images and actions up to permutation and element-wise transformations.
This allows us to apply BISCUIT to realistic simulated environments for embodied AI, where we can learn a latent representation that allows us to identify and manipulate each causal variable, as well as a mapping between each high-level action and its effects on the latent causal variables.

**Bio**
